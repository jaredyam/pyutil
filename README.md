ðŸ“¦ pyutil.sublime - plugins
===========================

*Tiny commands, easy life.* A collection of tiny commands could let me code with ST3 more comfortably.

**Note:**

- All commands that invoke the terminal will open the `Terminal` application by default, thereby restricted to run on macOS only
- `create_new_file` supposes that the shell command `subl` for invoking ST3 from command line is available

## Installation

- **Git**: clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jaredyam/pyutil.git
    ```

    The "Packages" directory on macOS is located at:

    ```bash
    ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/
    ```
